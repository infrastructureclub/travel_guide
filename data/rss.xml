      <link>https://infrastructureclub.org/travel_guide/#anita-street-municipal-housing-development</link>
      <description>Late Victorian municipal housing development; was originally going to be named Sanitary Street, but the residents didn't like it and 'S' and 'ry' were dropped. When you are here, do also check out Victoria Square, the block at the eastern end of the street: the first example of municipal housing in Manchester.</description>

      <title>Added "Amphitheater of El Jem" in El Jem, Tunisia</title>
      <link>https://infrastructureclub.org/travel_guide/#amphitheater-of-el-jem</link>
      <description>El Jem's Amphitheater and museum more than make up for the disappointment of Carthage, and it is well worth a special trip to see them.

The amphitheater is huge (3rd largest in the world), and at least has a little interpretation. You can climb all the way up to the highest levels and look down on the floor (and the town), and also explore the underground levels.

Honestly, it's better than the Roman Colosseum in many ways. Beautiful photography opportunities abound.

A 15 minute walk takes you to the museum, which is chock full of huge (room-sized) intact Roman mosaics. One of the best collections I've ever seen.

Worth at least an hour, two plus if you include the museum. A half day in El Jem is not out of order.

Held the first Sunday of each month, with occasional changes to avoid major holidays or for weather. There is an entry fee. Serious shoppers are wise to arrive early, but it's an amusing stroll at any time of day.</description>

      <title>Added "Heavy Load-bearing Body" in Schöneberg, Germany</title>
      <link>https://infrastructureclub.org/travel_guide/#heavy-load-bearing-body</link>
      <description>The Heavy Load-bearing Body is a giant concrete structure built to test how much load the ground in Berlin could hold to help with the Nazi plan to build a great big arch. It is quite a strange, squat concrete tower on an unassuming corner. Visiting hours are seasonal and they do guided tours daily. Entry is free.
