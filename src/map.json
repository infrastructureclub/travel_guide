Beautiful photography opportunities abound.\n\nA 15 minute walk takes you to the museum, which is chock full of huge (room-sized) intact Roman mosaics. One of the best collections I've ever seen.\n\nWorth at least an hour, two plus if you include the museum. A half day in El Jem is not out of order.\n\nAdded by grajohnt",

It is considered a masterpiece of Islamic architecture, but lacks the adornments common in later buildings. The 'uncountable' columns that hold up the vaulted ceilings are clearly reused Roman/Byzantine columns with a wild assortment of capitals and materials. Each one is a bit different in height, so they made up the difference with bricks before building the brick vaulted ceilings. There is carved Latin text (some upside-down) on the courtyard side of the minaret that clearly demonstrates the reuse of older material.\n\nThe whole courtyard is a rainwater collection system, and there are circular wells on the north end of the courtyard where you can peek down into the massive cisterns built underneath.\n\nThe little staircase in the middle of the courtyard leads to a sundial, which is also worth a look.\n\nWorth at least half an hour to look around - more if you're really into Roman columns.\n\nAdded by grajohnt",

If you want to explore a similar structure, head to the Sousse Ribat on the other side of the medina. (The mosque isn't worth a visit, sadly).\n\nAllow an hour or two for a visit.

If you're in Touzeur, it's pretty easy to visit this spot, and hopefully it will get it out of your system.\n\nAbsolutely filled with touts offering camel tours and 4-wheeler excursions across the dunes, plus a smattering of shops with the same stuff you can find anywhere else.\n\nYou can walk around in the ruins of the Berber village and see some of the set additions made for Star Wars. These were clearly just barely good enough to work for a set, and are starting to get somewhat decrepit.\n\nThe drive out there is across the desert on a road that must be regularly 'plowed' to remove blowing sand. You will spend more time getting there than you do visiting, so enjoy this part!\n\nAdded by grajohnt",

In short, Canada includes its inland waters as contributing to the median line, while the US uses the low tide line.

Established to test the effects of various combinations of inorganic fertilizers (N, P, K, Na and Mg) and organic manures on the yield of winter wheat, many of these treatments continue today. A control strip has received no fertilizer or organic manures since 1843.

The heat is often extreme, the trails are exposed and exhausting (people forget they're at elevation when they're hot!), and the brush is deceptively thick, making it easy to get lost and take a step off a cliff. A truly alarming number of hikers have died here, and their remains often go unfound in the dense scrub and many tiny canyons.\n\nAlso the site of the folkloric lost Dutchman's gold (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Dutchman%27s_Gold_Mine), one of the more interesting and culturally important buried treasure stories of the West. In some versions, it's a small but very rich gold seam; in others, it's a cache of conquistador-looted gold hidden in a rock cleft by Apaches; presumably some people think it's aliens. Over the last century or more, large numbers of treasure hunters have, unsurprisingly, died while offtrail in this exceptionally dangerous landscape. This has only fed the legends of curses and increased the perceived value of the gold. There are entire (fairly entertaining) books just about the histories of the various expeditions.\n\nArizona State Parks advises you to plan your hike carefully, particularly as regards your water supply, and to stay strictly on marked trails. This is good advice.",
